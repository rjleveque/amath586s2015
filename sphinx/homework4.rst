- `hw4.pdf <_static/hw4.pdf>`_


- If you want to use latex for your solutions, you can start with the file
  `hw4.tex`, which includes commented-out sections where you can insert
  solutions.  This can be found in the class repository (after cloning and
  perhaps doing a `git pull`, see :ref:`class_repos`) 
  as `$AM586/homeworks/hw4/hw4.tex`.
