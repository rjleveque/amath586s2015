Homework format
---------------

Homework should be submitted online via the 
`Canvas page <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/962872/assignments>`_.

Written solutions should be submitted as pdf files (not Word, please).
Ideally these should be typeset using latex.  
(See :ref:`biblio_latex` for some sources).  
If necessary you can hand write
and scan, but typeset work is much easier to grade and is good practice.

You can also write analytical solutions in an
IPython notebook if you wish to, which makes it
particularly easy to mix analysis with code illustrations.
If you do so, submit both the `.ipynb` file and also the `pdf` generated by
`nbconvert`.

For computer code,
please include suitable documentation to describe
what you've done and also explain it in your written solutions when appropriate.
Include appropriate figures in your writeup.
