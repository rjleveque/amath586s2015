Code and notebooks
==================

Matlab scripts to accompany the book 
------------------------------------

See `the book webpage <http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/fdmbook/>`_

IPython / Jupyter notebooks
---------------------------

The list of notebooks below contains links to versions you can view online
via `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/>`_.  (Check out this link and
also the `gallery
<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks>`_
for lots of cool examples of notebooks and books/papers written in this format.)

If you want to modify something in a notebook and re-execute, you will need
to download the notebook (or find it in the :ref:`class_repos`, in the `codes`
directory).

You will need a recent version of IPython in order to run an `IPython
notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_ (recently renamed Jupyter
notebooks since they also support Julia, R, and other languages besides
Python).

Notebooks can be found in `$AM586/codes/` if you want to run the notebook.  

If you want to easily run notebooks without installing any software, you
might try :ref:`smc`.

- `Notebook 1
  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am586s2015/_static/notebook1.ipynb>`_
  illustrates Forward Euler and some stability issues.
  It can be found in `$AM586/codes/notebook1.ipynb` if you want to download and
  run the notebook.  

- `Notebook 2
  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am586s2015/_static/notebook2.ipynb>`_
  illustrates Forward Euler and some stability issues on a nonlinear problem.

- `Notebook 3
  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am586s2015/_static/notebook3.ipynb>`_
  illustrates the Boundary Locus Method to plot stability regions for LMMs.

- `Notebook 4
  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/faculty.washington.edu/rjl/classes/am586s2015/_static/notebook4.ipynb>`_
  illustrates plotting the stability region for a 1-step method
