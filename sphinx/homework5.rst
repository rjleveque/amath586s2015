Due by 11:00pm on May 26, 2015.  

**Note:** Submit via Canvas.

- `hw5.pdf <_static/hw5.pdf>`_


- If you want to use latex for your solutions, you can start with the file
  `hw5.tex`, which includes commented-out sections where you can insert
  solutions.  This can be found in the class repository (after cloning and
  perhaps doing a `git pull`, see :ref:`class_repos`) 
  as `$AM586/homeworks/hw5/hw5.tex`.
